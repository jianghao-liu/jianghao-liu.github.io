**Welcome! Let me guide you through my research journey.**

I am a cognitive neuroscientist investigating **visual mental imagery** and **aphantasia**, employing advanced neuroimaging techniques such as ultra-high-field 7T fMRI, DTI, and cognitive tasks.

In late 2023, I obtained my Ph.D in Cognitive Neuroscience from Sorbonne University after 4 years at **Paris Brain Institute**, under the supervision of [Paolo Bartolomeo](https://parisbraininstitute.org/collaborators/bartolomeo-paolo). My doctoral work mainly focused on 7T fMRI studies of visual mental imagery and also included spatiotemporal dynamics of the interaction between attention and conscious report.

My academic path began with a background in mechanical engineering for many years, which later led me to transition into bioengineering, driven by a fascination for the brain's inner workings.

Below, you’ll find my latest updates, [publications](/publications/), ongoing projects, some [Research blogs](/blog/), social media links (some pages are still under construction).

**Feel free to reach out**—I’d love to connect!
