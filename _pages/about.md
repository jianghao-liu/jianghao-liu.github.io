I'm working on *visual mental imagery*, *aphantasia* and topics associated with *attention and consciousness*. I use neuroimaging techniques including 7T fMRI, DTI and intracranial recording.

Originally trained in mechanical engineering for many years, I later transitioned into the field of neuroscience.
