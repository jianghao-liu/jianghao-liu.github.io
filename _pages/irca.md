**IRCA** (Interdisciplinary Reading Club of Aphantasia) was co-founded by Christian O. Sholtz and myself in 2024 to advance interdisciplinary studies of aphantasia.

We host monthly online meetings where researchers from diverse fields—including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy—discuss recent findings, share methodologies, and explore new directions in aphantasia research.
